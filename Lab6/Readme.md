# Choreographing Movement
Andrew Violette amv78

It is about time to have a functioning mobile robot! Starting from this lab, you should prioritize either robot building and/or study design. 

### Deliverables for this lab are: 

0. Photos of your robot prototype
1. A video of your robot moving around
2. A sketch of a series movements based on your final project
3. A video showing your robot perform the movements in item #2.
4. Reflect upon your design, what would you do differently?


See 20230316_Lab6_Robochoreagraphy.pdf for lab deliverables and 20230314_Jackal_Mount_Notes.pdf for the design/prototyping of the chassis.
