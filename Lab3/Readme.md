# Make the Robot Move
**Nhan Tran nt322 and Andrew Violette amv78.**


In this week's lab, you will lay the foundations for your mobile robot. We will control commercially available hoverboards (Dr. Ju bought these on eBay) with ODrive motor controllers. This week's lab can be challenging. Be prepared to get your hands dirty.

### Again, deliverables for this lab are:
0. a video showing that you can control the hoverboard through python (functional checkoff. This is just to make sure you have a working set of hardware.)
1. three sketches of potential robots you can build with this platform (what furniture can you automate?)

Hoverboard not yet working.
See sketches.png for ideas of what to do with it.
